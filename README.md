## Configuring the Simulation
The Simulation can be configured via a Json File. An Example Json File can be found in the sq_sim_setup_generator/config folder.
The below code can be used to generate the simulation setup class from the json metadata. 
```python
from pysysq import *
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sim_setup = SQSimSetupGen(json_file='path/to/json_file')
    sim_setup.generate(output_folder='output')
```
### Configuring the Data Flow
Some times it is necessary to pass metadata generated by some simulation objects to another simulation object. 
In order to configure the data flow between simulation objects , the json file can specify the data flow elements. 
An example of data flow specification is shown below
```json
 {
          "name": "Processor1",
          "type": "SQPktProcessor",
          "description": "Processor",
          "default_factory": true,
          "factory_method": "create_packet_processor",
          "plot": true,
          "data_flow": [
            {
              "data":[ "progress"],
              "destination": "Processor2"
            }
          ],
          "clk":"Clock",
          "input_q": "Pkt_q",
          "output_q": "Proc_q"
      }
```
In the above example the Processor1 object is configured to pass the progress metadata to the Processor2 object.
The Processor2 can access the progress metadata by accessing the list  member `self.data_flow_map`. The `data_flow_map` constains a list of SQMetadata objects which are updated based on the generated new values of the metadata.
#### SQMetadata
The SQMetadata class is a simple class that holds the metadata information. The class has the following properties
- `name`: The name of the metadata
- `value`: The value of the metadata
- `owner`: The owner of the metadata
In order to access the metadata in the destination object , the destination object can access the metadata by the following code
```python
metadata = self.get_metadata_received(owner='Processor1',data_name='progress')
value = metadata.value
```
## Running the Simulation
Once the Simulation setup is generated the simulation can be run by executing the simulation setup file generated. 
```python
python  simulator.py # The simulator.py is the file generated by the SQSimSetupGen class
```
## Analysing Simulation Results
The PysysQ package provides a way to register properties from each of the Simulation Objects. 
The Package comes with some preconfigured properties for the above simulation objects. 
For example The SQPktProcessor comes inbuilt with the property `load` indicating the load on the PacketProcessor. 
The SQQueue comes inbuilt with the property `pending_pkts` indicating the number of packets pending in the queue.

The pysysq simulator samples  the registered properties from the simulation objects at each simulation ticks. The information is stored in a statistics object. 
Later at the end of the simulation the statisitcs can be plotted in a graph using `SQPlotter` class.
In order to enable plotting for an object set the `plot` property to `true` in the json file for the simulation object. 

### Adding new properties from helper classes. 
In order to register a new property from the helper class , the helper class can first add a member attribute in the class 
then call the `register_property` method in the owner class to register the property.

```python
from pysysq import *
class FilterHelper(SQFilterHelper):
    def __init__(self):
        self.filter_result = False
    def set_owner(self,owner):
        self.owner = owner
        self.owner.register_property(owner=self,name='filter_result')
    def filter(self,pkt):
        self.filter_result =! self.filter_result
        return self.filteer_result
```
Now if the plot property of the Filter object is set to true in the json at the end of simulation a plot of the Property value `filter_result` will be plotted against each simulation tick.
